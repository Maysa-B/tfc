## Trybe Futebol Clube

The project was developed at the end of Trybe's 28th block, where I studied using _Typescript with Sequelize_.

### How it works

Trybe was responsible for producing all front-end website and for it works correctly, I made an API to complete the whole application. Aside from that, I tested the backend part with Mocha, Chai, and Sinon.

I learned a new tool as well. It is called Bcrypt, it hashes your password to be encrypted in the datase, so no one can understand it, ensuring more security.

### How to use it

First, you need to clone this repository and change it to the directory cloned. 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Maysa-B/tfc.git

cd tfc

npm install
```

After that, it's necessary to run an `npm run compose:up` to set all configurations up.

Once is finished, you can access the front-end folder and go up the application.

```bash
cd app/frontend

npm start
```
